# Contact Form Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the contact form functionality for the Romanian Business Hub website.

## Problem
The contact form on the website was not working. It only logged messages to the browser console and did not save them anywhere or send emails.

## Solution
Implemented a database-backed contact form that saves all contact messages to a Supabase database table.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration
Created a new migration file: `supabase/migrations/20251017213800_create_contact_messages_table.sql`

This migration creates:
- A `contact_messages` table with the following columns:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `name` (TEXT, required)
  - `email` (TEXT, required)
  - `subject` (TEXT, required)
  - `message` (TEXT, required)
  - `status` (TEXT, default 'unread', with check constraint)
  - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)

- Indexes for better query performance:
  - `idx_contact_messages_status` on status column
  - `idx_contact_messages_created_at` on created_at column

- Row Level Security (RLS) policies:
  - Anyone can insert (submit) a contact message
  - Only authenticated admin users can view messages

### 2. TypeScript Types
Updated `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` to include the `contact_messages` table type definitions.

### 3. Contact Page Component
Updated `src/pages/ContactPage.tsx` with:
- Import of Supabase client
- Added `isSubmitting` state to prevent double submissions
- Changed `handleSubmit` from synchronous to async function
- Implemented actual database insertion using Supabase
- Added proper error handling with user-friendly error messages
- Updated submit button to show loading state ("Sending..." when submitting)
- Disabled button during submission to prevent multiple clicks

## How It Works

1. **User Submission**: When a user fills out and submits the contact form:
   - The form data is sent to Supabase's `contact_messages` table
   - The message is stored with a status of 'unread'
   - User receives a success toast notification

2. **Error Handling**: If there's an error:
   - The error is logged to the console for debugging
   - User receives an error toast with a helpful message
   - Form data is preserved so the user can try again

3. **Data Storage**: All messages are stored in Supabase with:
   - Timestamp of submission
   - Complete contact information
   - Full message content
   - Status tracking (unread/read/replied)

## Accessing Contact Messages

### For Website Administrators
Messages can be accessed through:

1. **Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Log in to the Supabase project at https://supabase.com
   - Navigate to Table Editor
   - Select the `contact_messages` table
   - View all submitted messages with filtering and sorting options

2. **SQL Query** (via Supabase SQL Editor):
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     id,
     name,
     email,
     subject,
     message,
     status,
     created_at
   FROM contact_messages
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```

3. **Future Enhancement**: Consider building an admin panel within the application to manage contact messages.

## Testing

To test the contact form:

1. Navigate to the Contact page: `/contact`
2. Fill in all required fields:
   - Your Name
   - Your Email
   - Subject
   - Your Message
3. Click "Send Message"
4. Verify success message appears
5. Check Supabase dashboard to confirm message was saved

## Security Considerations

- **RLS Policies**: Row Level Security is enabled to ensure:
  - Public users can only insert (not read) messages
  - Only authenticated admins can view messages
  - Prevents unauthorized access to contact information

- **Input Validation**: 
  - HTML5 form validation for required fields and email format
  - Server-side validation via Supabase schema constraints

- **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting in the future to prevent spam

## Future Enhancements

1. **Email Notifications**: 
   - Set up Supabase Edge Functions or a third-party service to send email notifications when new messages arrive
   - Send auto-reply emails to users confirming receipt of their message

2. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Build an admin interface to view, manage, and respond to messages
   - Implement status tracking (unread → read → replied)
   - Add message filtering and search capabilities

3. **Spam Protection**:
   - Add CAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA
   - Implement rate limiting per IP address
   - Add honeypot fields

4. **Analytics**:
   - Track message submission rates
   - Monitor response times
   - Identify common topics/categories

## Migration Instructions

To apply this migration to your Supabase project:

1. Using Supabase CLI:
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

2. Manual application (via Supabase Dashboard):
   - Copy the contents of `supabase/migrations/20251017213800_create_contact_messages_table.sql`
   - Navigate to SQL Editor in Supabase Dashboard
   - Paste and execute the SQL script
