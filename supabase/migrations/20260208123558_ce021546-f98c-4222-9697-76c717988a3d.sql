  content_en = E'Tired of being just an employee and want to turn your passion or talent into a business? Many Romanians in Flanders, Wallonia, or Brussels are already doing this successfully. However, the big barrier remains the question: "How do I start as self-employed in Belgium without getting lost in bureaucracy?"\n\nIn this guide, we explain everything you need to know about the necessary documents, startup costs, and how to avoid mistakes that can cost you thousands of euros in taxes.\n\n1. Types of Self-Employment: Hoofdberoep vs. Bijberoep\n\nIn Belgium, you have two major options depending on your current situation:\n\nSelf-employed as main occupation (Zelfstandige in hoofdberoep): If this is your only source of income.\n\nSelf-employed as secondary occupation (Zelfstandige in bijberoep): Ideal if you are already employed (at least 50%) and want to test a business idea without giving up the security of your salary. This is the safest way to start a self-employed activity in Belgium.\n\n2. Choosing the Legal Form: Sole Proprietorship or Company (BV)?\n\nChoosing the form of organization is the first critical step.\n\nSole Proprietorship (Zelfstandige)\n\nThis is the equivalent of a PFA (sole trader) in Belgium.\nIdeal for: Craftsmen, consultants starting out, small service providers.\nAdvantage: Very low setup and accounting costs.\nRisk: There is no separation between your personal assets and those of the business.\n\nCompany (BV / NV)\n\nIdeal for: Businesses with growth potential, large investments, or teams.\nAdvantage: Personal assets are protected. If the business has debts, your personal home and car are generally safe.\n\n3. Steps and Documents Required for Registration in 2026\n\nTo obtain the right to invoice, you need to follow these steps:\n\nA. Professional Bank Account\n\nBefore anything else, open a separate bank account for your business. It is mandatory and helps you not mix personal and business expenses.\n\nB. Registration at KBO/BCE (Crossroads Bank for Enterprises)\n\nYou need to register at an enterprise counter (ondernemingsloket). Here you will receive your unique enterprise number.\nEstimated cost: ~€109.50\n\nC. VAT Number Activation\n\nAfter obtaining your KBO number, it must be activated for VAT (BTW).\nEstimated cost: ~€70 (plus administration fees if you use an expert).\n\nD. Registration with a Social Insurance Fund\n\nAs a self-employed person in Belgium, you are responsible for your own pension and health contributions. Registration is mandatory before you actually start working.\n\n4. Monthly Costs and Optimization: The Role of the Accountant\n\nDon''t leave accounting to the last minute. A good accountant for Romanians in Belgium will cost between €150 and €250 per month, but will help you:\n\nDeduct expenses correctly (car, phone, office rent);\nPay lower taxes through legal optimizations;\nFile declarations on time, avoiding hefty fines.\n\nGolden Rule: Set aside between 35% and 40% of each invoice collected. This money is not yours—it is the reserve for income tax and social contributions at the end of the year.\n\n5. The "Testing" Solution: Payrolling through Tentoo\n\nDoes it seem too complicated to start a company now? Tentoo Payroll Services is the preferred solution for many Romanians.\n\nHow does it work? You find the client, Tentoo issues the invoice, and you receive the net salary.\nAdvantage: You have employee status (full social protection) but freelancer freedom. It is the fastest method to start without bureaucracy.\n\nConclusion: Your Business Deserves to Be Seen!\n\nOnce you have your documents ready, the next step is to find clients. A successful business needs visibility in the Romanian community.\n\nRegister your business on Romanian Business Hub to be easily found by clients in your area. Whether you are a plumber, programmer, beautician, or consultant, we help you be just one click away from those who need you.\n\nHave questions about the process?
