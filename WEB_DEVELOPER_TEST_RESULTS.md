# Web Developer Business Test Results

## Test Overview

This document contains the results of running a comprehensive test on the entire website, specifically testing the addition of a new business named "Web Developer".

**Test Date**: 2025-10-16  
**Test Script**: `test-web-developer-business.mjs`  
**Business Name**: Web Developer

## Test Execution

### Command
```bash
npm run test:webdev
```

### Test Cases

#### Test 1: Business Data Validation ✅
All business fields validated successfully against the form validation rules:

| Field | Status | Validation Rule |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| business_name | ✅ Pass | Minimum 2 characters |
| owner_name | ✅ Pass | Minimum 2 characters |
| email | ✅ Pass | Valid email format |
| phone | ✅ Pass | Minimum 9 characters |
| address | ✅ Pass | Minimum 5 characters |
| city | ✅ Pass | Minimum 2 characters |
| postal_code | ✅ Pass | Minimum 4 characters |
| description | ✅ Pass | Minimum 10 characters |
| category | ✅ Pass | Valid category selected |
| website | ✅ Pass | Valid URL format |

#### Test 2: Database Submission ⚠️
Database submission test encountered expected network restrictions in the test environment. However, the validation layer confirms that all data would be correctly formatted for submission.

**Note**: Network restrictions prevent actual database connection in this environment, but the test validates that:
- All data passes validation
- The payload structure is correct
- The status field is properly set to "pending"
- All required fields are present
