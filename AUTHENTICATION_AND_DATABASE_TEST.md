# Authentication and Database Integration Test Report

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Purpose:** Test the complete authentication flow and database integration for Add Business functionality  
**Issue Reference:** "I still get the same error when I try to add a new business"

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive guide to testing the authentication flow and database integration for adding businesses to the Romanian Business Hub platform.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Authentication system is properly implemented with Supabase Auth
- ✅ Add Business functionality requires user authentication (by design)
- ✅ Database schema includes `user_id` column with proper RLS policies
- ⚠️ Users MUST create an account and log in BEFORE adding a business

---

## Authentication Flow Test

### Page: `/auth` - Login/Sign Up

**Sign Up Form:**
- Email field (your@email.com)
- Password field (minimum requirements apply)
- "Create Account" button
- Toggle to "Already have an account? Login"

**Login Form:**
- Email field
- Password field
- "Login" button
- Toggle to "Don't have an account? Sign up"

**Screenshot:** `test-screenshots/06-auth-login-page.png` (Login view)  
**Screenshot:** `test-screenshots/12-auth-signup-page.png` (Sign up view)

### Expected Authentication Flow

```
1. User visits /auth
2. User clicks "Don't have an account? Sign up"
3. User enters email and password (min 6 characters)
4. User clicks "Create Account"
5. Supabase creates account and sends confirmation email (if configured)
6. User is automatically logged in
7. User is redirected or can navigate to /add-business
```

### Testing Authentication Status

**Method 1: Check Account Page**
1. Navigate to `/account`
2. If logged in, you'll see your email in the disabled Email field
3. If not logged in, the page will show empty or redirect

**Method 2: Browser Console**
```javascript
// Open browser console (F12) and run:
const { data } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
console.log('Current user:', data.user);
// If logged in: Will show user object with id, email, etc.
// If logged out: data.user will be null
```

## Database Integration Test

### Database Schema

**Table:** `businesses`

```sql
CREATE TABLE businesses (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  business_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  owner_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  phone TEXT NOT NULL,
  address TEXT NOT NULL,
  city TEXT NOT NULL,
  postal_code TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  category TEXT NOT NULL,
  website TEXT,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

**Policy 1: Public Read for Approved Businesses**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view approved businesses"
  ON businesses FOR SELECT
  USING (status = 'approved');
```

**Policy 2: Authenticated Create**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can create businesses"
  ON businesses FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

This policy ensures:
- Only logged-in users can insert businesses
- Users can only create businesses linked to their own user_id
- Anonymous users cannot insert businesses

## Error Scenarios and Solutions

### Error 1: "You must be logged in to submit a business"

**Cause:** User is not authenticated

**Solution:**
1. Navigate to `/auth`
2. Create an account or log in
3. Verify authentication by visiting `/account`
4. Return to `/add-business` and try again

**How to Verify:** Check browser console for authentication status:
```javascript
const { data } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
console.log('User:', data.user); // Should not be null
```

---

### Error 2: RLS Policy Violation

**Error Message:**
```
new row violates row-level security policy for table "businesses"
```

**Cause:** Database migration not applied or RLS policy misconfigured

**Solution for Developers:**

1. **Check if user_id column exists:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'businesses' AND column_name = 'user_id';
```

2. **Check RLS policies:**
```sql
SELECT 
  schemaname, 
  tablename, 
  policyname, 
  permissive, 
  roles, 
  cmd, 
  qual, 
  with_check
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'businesses';
```

3. **Apply migration if missing:**
   - Navigate to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
   - Copy contents of `supabase/migrations/20251016204348_add_user_id_to_businesses.sql`
   - Execute the SQL
   - Verify migration applied

### Error 3: Network/Connection Issues

**Error Message:**
```
There was an error submitting your business. Please try again.
```

**Possible Causes:**
- No internet connection
- Supabase service down
- Invalid Supabase credentials in .env

**Solution:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify Supabase project status at https://app.supabase.com
3. Verify environment variables in `.env`:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://qwwvnxrduakmrgdmiccs.supabase.co

```typescript
// Get the current user
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();

if (!user) {
  throw new Error("You must be logged in to submit a business");
}
```

**Database Insert with user_id (Lines 49-66):**
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('businesses')
  .insert({
    business_name: values.businessName,
    owner_name: values.ownerName,
    email: values.email,
    phone: values.phone,
    address: values.address,
    city: values.city,
    postal_code: values.postalCode,
    description: values.description,
    category: values.category,
    website: values.website || null,
    status: 'pending',
    user_id: user.id  // Links business to authenticated user
  })
  .select()
  .single();
```

2. Creates foreign key constraint to `auth.users`
3. Implements CASCADE deletion
4. Updates RLS policies for authenticated operations
5. Ensures only authenticated users can submit businesses
6. Prevents users from creating businesses under other user IDs

**Status:** ✅ Already implemented in codebase
